# CustomContest
An app to choose desired question and schedule time to solve them like a contest for better discipline.

Add links of questions you want to solve. 
Add time at which the contest should be started. 
The code will automatically open the link and start the timer per question based on the difficulty. 
Once the time gets over, it will redirect to the next link.
The statistics will be collected and be presented when the overall time gets over in a new custom page. 
Also, the statistics will be available in the app for performance tracking.
